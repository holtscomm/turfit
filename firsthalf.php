  <p><strong>Located in Saskatoon's historic Holiday Park neighbourhood, the Bowl at Gordon Howe Park opened in September of 1960 and has since become a local landmark, attracting athletes and spectators from across the province.</strong></p>
  <p>The Bowl is the past and present home of multiple distinguished Saskatoon football programs, and has been the site of friendly high school rivalries for decades. It is no surprise that after 53 years of service the facility has outperformed its original life expectancy and is no longer able to meet present, let alone future demands. Our athletic tradition is strong, but improvements to the Bowl are necessary
  to maintain Saskatoon's competitiveness in the football community.</p>
  <p>The Bowl has been the home of football in our city for years and has fed all senior levels, including our champions the Hilltops, Valkyries, Huskies, and Saskatchewan Roughriders.</p>
  <div class="jumbotron">

      The venue will be viable for eight months of the year instead of four.<br>
      This will increase its annual usage from 135 hours to OVER 1600!
